    #   Pied Piper is a multi-platform technology based on a proprietary universal compression algorithm that has
    #   consistently fielded high Weisman Scoresâ„¢ that are not merely competitive,
    #   but approach the theoretical limit of lossless compression.
    # highlights:
    #   - "Photonics design and integration, DARPA PIPES program, led the Phase 2 development and the successful transition to Phase 3"
    #   - "Contributed to the writing and visualization of the proposal that led to the award of $35M JUMP 2.0 grant for the CUbiC Center"
    #   - "Co-led the CUbiC Scholar Leadership Council and the Systems and Testbeds subgroup; organized monthly workshops with industry liaisons"
