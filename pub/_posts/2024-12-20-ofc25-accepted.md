In this paper, we present a robust channel calibration algorithm designed for Kerr comb-driven microresonator-based dense wavelength-division multiplexing (DWDM) systems, addressing challenges in scalable initialization for multi-FSR architectures. By leveraging the spectral properties of Kerr frequency combs, the algorithm achieves precise in-order alignment of resonator channels while mitigating issues like resonance aliases and wafer-scale process variations. Experimental validation demonstrates successful calibration under real-world conditions using silicon photonic circuits and thermal tuning, showcasing its practicality and potential for advancing scalable photonic connectivity in high-performance computing systems.
