In this talk, we present a scalable architecture for multi-Tbps dense wavelength-division multiplexing (DWDM) silicon photonic transceivers leveraging Kerr frequency combs. The design introduces a multi-bus, even-odd channel interleaving scheme and a novel multi-FSR (free spectral range) arrangement, addressing the spectral and device limitations of traditional single-bus architectures. The design also accommodates various considerations, including fabrication robustness, thermal variations, and non-idealities in device and system performance. Full-link simulations validate the architectureâ€™s efficacy, demonstrating error-free transmission across 64 channels, paving the way for next-generation, energy-efficient chip-to-chip connectivity in data centers and high-performance computing systems.
