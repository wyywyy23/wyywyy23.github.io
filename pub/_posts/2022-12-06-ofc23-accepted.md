In this paper, we present a validated design methodology for engineering the width of silicon-on-insulator (SOI) waveguides to achieve co-optimized group velocity dispersion (GVD) and fabrication robustness, addressing critical challenges in dense wavelength-division multiplexing (DWDM) for silicon photonic communication systems.
