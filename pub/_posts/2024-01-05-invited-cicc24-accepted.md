# Invited Paper at IEEE CICC 2024

> Read the full paper to be presented at the 2024 IEEE Custom Integrated Circuits Conference (CICC) [here](http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/CICC60959.2024.10529018).

In this paper, we present the design and characterization of a silicon photonics (SiPh) transceiver chip aimed at ultra-high bandwidth and energy-efficient die-to-die connectivity. This chip employs a dense wavelength-division multiplexing (DWDM) approach in the multi-free spectral range (FSR) regime, targeting a bandwidth density of over 2 Tbps/mm with energy consumption below 1 pJ/bit. We review the link architecture and photonic integrated circuit (PIC) design, detailing key components such as even-odd (de-)interleavers, vertical-junction microdisk modulators, and add-drop filter arrays. The paper also discusses the implications of process variations and wafer-scale substrate undercuts on energy efficiency, ultimately proposing a scalable solution for future high-performance computing and data center networks.
