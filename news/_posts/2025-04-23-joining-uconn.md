# Joining UConn This Fall!

I am thrilled to announce that I have accepted an offer for tenure-track faculty at the University of Connecticut! I am extremely thankful to everyone who mentored and helped me along the way, from the beginning of my journey as an undergraduate student at Tsinghua University, through my PhD at UC Santa Barbara, and during my postdoc at Columbia University.

My work will be focused on the intersection of integrated photonics and computing systems. Specifically, I am interested in exploring future photonics-enabled computing architectures, advanced packaging, and design automation to build these systems.

Starting this fall, I will be in search of talented PhD students and postdoctoral researchers who are interested in addressing these challenges as well as the complexity of the system design. If you or someone you know is applying, please encourage them to contact me!
