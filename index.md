> "Embrace light. Admire it. Love it. But above all, know light." â€” George Eastman

I am joining the University of Connecticut as an Assistant Professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering in Fall 2025. I am looking for motivated Ph.D. students and postdocs to join my research group. If you are interested in working with me, please feel free to reach out at yuyang.wang [at] uconn [dot] edu.
{:.note title="ðŸ“¢ Looking for Students"}

I am currently a Postdoctoral Research Scientist in the [Lightwave Research Laboratory](https://lightwave.ee.columbia.edu) at the Columbia University in the City of New York, supervised by [Prof. Keren Bergman](https://lightwave.ee.columbia.edu/bergman). I design **large-scale integrated photonic systems** to transform future computing paradigms. Addressing communication bottlenecks in AI/machine learning applications through embedded photonic I/O and heterogeneous integration, I aim to redefine chip-to-chip connectivity with unparalleled density and novel functionalities beyond data communication.

I obtained my Ph.D. degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the University of California, Santa Barbara, in 2021, co-advised by [Prof. Kwang-Ting Cheng](https://seng.hkust.edu.hk/about/people/faculty/tim-kwang-ting-cheng) and [Prof. John E. Bowers](https://engineering.ucsb.edu/people/john-bowers). I earned my B.Eng. degree in Electronic Engineering from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2015.
