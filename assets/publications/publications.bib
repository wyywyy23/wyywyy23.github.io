@article{novickHighbandwidthDensitySilicon2023,
  abstract  = {The growth of artificial intelligence applications demands ever larger and more complex deep learning models, dominating today's---and tomorrow's---data center and high-performance computing systems. While traditional electronics are failing to keep pace with application demands, silicon photonic (SiPh) interconnects have emerged as a necessary technology to support these systems. SiPh-driven wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) offers a particularly promising path toward supporting incredibly high-aggregate link bandwidth in a compact and efficient form factor. One of the basic building blocks of these integrated WDM interconnects is the SiPh resonator. Their inherent wavelength selectivity and compact footprint allow for efficient data transmission multiplexed across dozens of carrier wavelengths. Used as add-drop (AD) filters, SiPh resonators are critical to constructing integrated tunable wavelength-selective optical circuit switches as well as for demultiplexing the different carrier wavelengths toward independent wavelength-insensitive photodiodes in a dense wavelength-division multiplexing receiver. Resonators in the all-pass (AP) configuration are widespread as well, allowing for wavelength-selective modulation to drive aggregate link bandwidths far beyond the individual channel data rate. Unlike SiPh Mach--Zehnder modulators (MZM), resonant modulators can be driven using low, complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor drive voltages, allowing for tight co-integration between photonic integrated circuits, fabricated with larger process node technologies, and electronic integrated circuits, designed to exploit the advantages of the latest node. To push toward practical peta-scale interconnects, a comprehensive review of SiPh resonators is required, addressing bottlenecks and design constraints at both the architecture and device levels. We first describe the predominant integrated link architectures and identify their limits. We then discuss the device-level design considerations that can be made for both AD and AP configuration resonators to overcome the system level limits with novel resonator device designs. Analytical models and numerical simulation of resonators are validated by experimental measurement of devices fabricated in a commercial 300-mm foundry, showing a clear path toward volume manufacturing. The demonstrated resonant modulators and filters support the feasibility of increasing the aggregate bandwidth of resonator-driven SiPh interconnects into the peta-scale regime.},

@preprint{parsonsUltraEfficientThermallyUndercut2025,
  abstract      = {Silicon photonic devices fundamental to high-density wavelength-division multiplexed (DWDM) optical links and photonic switching networks, such as resonant modulators and Mach-Zehnder interferometers (MZIs), are highly sensitive to fabrication variations and operational temperature swings. However, thermal tuning to compensate for fabrication and operational temperature variations can result in prohibitive power consumption, challenging the scalability of energy-efficient photonic integrated circuits (PICs). In this work, we develop and demonstrate a wafer-scale thermal undercut in a 300 mm complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) foundry that dramatically improves the thermal isolation of thermo-optic devices by selectively removing substrate material beneath the waveguides and resonators. This approach significantly reduces the power required for thermal tuning across multiple device architectures, achieving almost a 5\${\textbackslash}times\$ improvement in tuning efficiency in a state-of-the-art 4.5 \${\textbackslash}mu\$m radius microdisk modulator and a 40\${\textbackslash}times\$ improvement in efficiency for a MZI phase shifter. Additionally, to the best of the authors' knowledge, we demonstrate the first wafer-scale analysis of the impact of undercut trench geometry on device performance using comprehensive wafer-scale measurements across 64 reticles of a 300 mm silicon-on-insulator (SOI) wafer. These results highlight the effectiveness of this wafer-scale thermal undercut technique in minimizing energy consumption, paving the way for scalable, ultra low-power silicon photonic systems.},

@phdthesis{wangModelingSimulationOptimization2021,
  abstract  = {The explosive growth of data volume brought by the pervasiveness of artificial intelligence (AI) applications is calling for interconnect technologies that enable higher bandwidth capacity at a lower cost. In particular, optical interconnects based on silicon photonics are considered a promising substitute for electrical ones, given their cost-effectiveness and scalability enabled by a CMOS-compatible fabrication process. However, as the optical interconnects further penetrate the shorter-reach regime, several issues arise from the growing complexity of system integration and pose challenges to their design quality, including 1) inadequate support from design automation methodologies for the modeling and simulation of the optical interconnects, 2) oversimplified characterization of process variations, resulting in variation alleviation techniques with limited effectiveness, and 3) the lack of runtime reconfiguration strategies for the optical interconnects under traffic dynamics, leading to unoptimized energy efficiency. This dissertation is devoted to addressing the above issues by solutions proposed at the device, link, and system levels, paving the way to the quality design of variation-aware runtime-reconfigurable optical interconnects with optimized energy efficiency. The first part of this dissertation focuses on device-level methodologies for electronic-photonic design automation (EPDA), including compact models developed for lasers and modulators and a novel hierarchical spatial variation model characterized for silicon microring resonators. Extensively validated by measurement data, the library of device-level models enables accurate circuit-level simulation of optical links and variation-aware estimation of the link power budget, serving as the fundamentals of the optimization techniques proposed at the link and system levels. The second part of this dissertation proposes three link-level techniques to improve the energy efficiency of the optical interconnects under wafer-scale process variations. The three techniques exploit, respectively, 1) sub-channel redundancy of carrier wavelengths, 2) a combination of electrical and thermal tuning mechanisms, and 3) optimal mixing and matching of a batch of fabricated transceivers, achieving significant reductions in the energy required for transmitting a single bit of data. The third and final part of this dissertation proposes two strategies at the system level that further improve the energy efficiency of the optical interconnects under traffic dynamics by reconfiguring the link power at application runtime. The two strategies incorporate assistance from 1) traffic adjustment enabled by task mapping exploration and 2) traffic adaptability enabled by traffic prediction, respectively, and achieve substantial improvements in energy consumption with minimal overhead to application execution time, notably outperforming existing strategies.},

@article{wuFlexibleSiliconPhotonic2024,
  abstract  = {The increasing size and complexity of deep learning (DL) models have led to the wide adoption of distributed training methods in datacenters (DCs) and high-performance computing (HPC) systems. However, communication among distributed computing units (CUs) has emerged as a major bottleneck in the training process. In this study, we propose Flex-SiPAC, a flexible silicon photonic accelerated compute cluster designed to accelerate multi-tenant distributed DL training workloads. Flex-SiPAC takes a co-design approach that combines a silicon photonic hardware platform with a tailored collective algorithm, optimized to leverage the unique physical properties of the architecture. The hardware platform integrates a novel wavelength-reconfigurable transceiver design and a micro-resonator-based wavelength-reconfigurable switch, enabling the system to achieve flexible bandwidth steering in the wavelength domain. The collective algorithm is designed to support reconfigurable topologies, enabling efficient all-reduce communications that are commonly used in DL training. The feasibility of the Flex-SiPAC architecture is demonstrated through two testbed experiments. First, an optical testbed experiment demonstrates the flexible routing of wavelengths by shuffling an array of input wavelengths using a custom-designed spatial-wavelength selective switch. Second, a four-GPU testbed running two DL workloads shows a 23\% improvement in job completion time compared to a similarly sized leaf-spine topology. We further evaluate Flex-SiPAC using large-scale simulations, which show that Flex-SiPAC is able to reduce the communication time by 26\% to 29\% compared to state-of-the-art compute clusters under representative collective operations.},
